Aberdeen & Aberdeenshire

Aberdeen, often referred to as the "Granite City" for its many enduring grey-stone buildings, is the gateway to the enchanting Aberdeenshire region. This city combines the charm of the old with the vibrancy of the new, offering visitors a taste of Scotland's rich history alongside modern amenities. Aberdeen serves as an ideal base for invading the majestic landscapes and historical sites of Aberdeenshire.

Day 1: Invading Aberdeen

Upon landing in Aberdeen on a Sunday afternoon, we headed straight to our Airbnb after picking up our rented car at the airport. By 4 pm, we were ready to start our Aberdeenshire adventure in the waning daylight.

Fittie (Footdee)

First, our troops conquered Fittie, also known as Footdee, a quaint fishermen village within Aberdeen itself. This village is a preserved gem, where the pace of life seems unhurried, set against a backdrop of narrow lanes and vibrant cottages. It's a perfect introduction to the region's maritime heritage.

Old Aberdeen

As dusk fell, we strolled through Old Aberdeen, its ancient ambiance magnified by the glow of streetlights on wet cobblestones. Though our visit was brief, the charm of St Machar's Cathedral and King's College Chapel, nestled within the University of Aberdeen, was unmistakable. These sites are must-visits for history enthusiasts.

The Esselmont

Dinner was at The Esselmont, where we indulged in traditional Scottish fare with a modern twist. Haggis bon bons and crovies croquettes started the meal, followed by main courses of venison and Balmoral chicken. The restaurant's blend of delicious food and a welcoming atmosphere made it a memorable first meal in Aberdeen.

Day 2: Discovering Aberdeenshire's Gems

Stonehaven

A short drive from Aberdeen, Stonehaven, a charming coastal village, awaited us. Our day began with a hearty full Scottish breakfast at "The Red Red Robin," a local favorite known for its fresh, homemade offerings. Sampling the iconic Irn Bru added an authentic touch to our Scottish culinary experience.

Dunnottar Castle

The highlight of the day was undoubtedly Dunnottar Castle. This iconic fortress, perched on a rugged cliff overlooking the North Sea, is a sight to behold. Its rich history, stunning vistas, and natural surroundings make it a worthwhile visit for anyone exploring Scotland.

Inverurie Pictish Stones & Loanhead of Daviot Stone Circle

Our journey continued with a visit to Inverurie to marvel at the ancient Pictish Stones, a testament to Scotland's early history. En route to the Moray Firth, we stumbled upon the Loanhead of Daviot Stone Circle, a serene and mystical site that captivated us with its timeless beauty.

Crovie & Pennan

The discovery of Crovie, a picturesque village that had long been on our bucket list, was a highlight of the trip. Its secluded charm and breathtaking views were unparalleled. A short drive away, Pennan offered another quaint village experience, further enriching our journey through Aberdeenshire.

Coastal Way & Bullers of Buchan

Returning to Aberdeen, we opted for the scenic Coastal Way, reveling in the stunning landscapes and ocean views. Our stop at Bullers of Buchan, an underrated spot for birdwatching and nature enthusiasts, was marked by magical sunset hues.

The Old Friary & Bonus: Slains Castle

For dinner, we chose The Old Friary, known for its cozy atmosphere and delicious local cuisine. Though we missed visiting Slains Castle due to a closed road, it remains a recommended site for its dramatic setting and historical significance.

Day 3: The Majesty of the Cairngorms and Beyond

Cairngorms National Park

Our final day took us to the Cairngorms National Park, a natural paradise of forests, lochs, and wildlife. The park's vast landscapes offered countless opportunities for exploration and adventure.

Traimachan Café

A delightful lunch awaited at the Traimachan Café, where local ingredients and traditional recipes provided a perfect culinary pause in our day.

Balmoral Castle

Next, we visited Balmoral Castle, the Scottish residence of the British Royal Family. The castle's grounds and gardens offered a glimpse into royal life and the natural beauty of the region.

Craigievar Castle

The fairytale-like Craigievar Castle, with its stunning pink façade and historical artifacts, was another highlight, showcasing Scotland's architectural diversity and heritage.

Deeside Way Villages

We concluded our journey with a leisurely drive through the villages along the Deeside Way, each offering its unique charm and history.
